I gave a talk about GraphGAN on November 27, 2017, at Microsoft Research Asia. GraphGAN is a adversarial model for graph representation learning (or network embedding), which is accepted as a full paper [GraphGAN: Graph Representation Learning with Generative Adversarial Nets](https://hwwang55.github.io/files/2018-AAAI-GraphGAN.pdf) by AAAI 2018. Slides is [here](https://hwwang55.github.io/files/2017-talks-GraphGAN-slides.pdf).
