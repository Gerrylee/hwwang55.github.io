Our full paper "[DKN: Deep Knowledge-Aware Network for News Recommendation](https://hwwang55.github.io/files/2018-WWW-DKN.pdf)" is accepted by WWW 2018 industry track.
DKN is a CNN based deep model incorporating knowledge graph into news recommendation.
Specifically, DKN uses TransX method for knowledge graph representation learning, then combines entity embedding with word embedding in a CNN framework.
In addition, we design a attention-based CTR prediction module to output the final click probability.
