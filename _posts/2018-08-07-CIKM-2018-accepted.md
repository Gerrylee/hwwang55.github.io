Our long paper "[RippleNet: Propagating User Preferences on the Knowledge Graph for Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03467)" is accepted by CIKM 2018.

RippleNet is a deep end-to-end model that naturally incorporates the knowledge graph into recommender systems.
Ripple Network overcomes the limitations of existing embedding-based and path-based KG-aware recommendation methods by introducing preference propagation, which automatically propagates users' potential preferences and explores their hierarchical interests in the KG.
Code is [here](https://github.com/hwwang55/RippleNet).

In addition, our short paper [Weakly-Supervised Generative Adversarial Nets with Auxiliary Information for Wireless Coverage Estimation]() is accepted by CIKM 2018.
