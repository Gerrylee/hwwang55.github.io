title: About me
subtitle: CS PhD candidate @ SJTU, full-time intern @ MSRA
---

- I'm a Ph. D. candidate at [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Prof. [Minyi Guo](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~guo-my/).
- I'm currently a full-time intern at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), supervised by [Dr. Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/).
- I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Fuzheng Zhang](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/fuzzhang/) in MSRA and [Prof. Miao Zhao](https://www.comp.polyu.edu.hk/en-us/staffs/detail/4319) in [the Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html).
- My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning and data mining, particularly in **recommender systems** and **graph data mining**. I also dabble inÂ **deep learning**, **natural language processing**, and **reinforcement learning**.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
