D. candidate at [the Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/) in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn), supervised by Prof. [Minyi Guo](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~guo-my/). My research interests include **recommender systems**, **representation learning**, **textual and graph mining**.
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
